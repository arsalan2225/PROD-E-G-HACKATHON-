We developed a website which consists of a home page in which there is a booking section in which a person can book their travelling tickets whether it will be train, plane, bus. Then there is a section in which a person will be able to book hotels, lodge, rooms, stay camps. The next section is of a guide so that they can travel without hesitation. There is a section where people can book tickets of famous tourism places instead of purchasing tickets standing in long queues. There is a section for downloading instructions manual of each site of tourism/video of instructions for better understanding. A chat assistant to solve real time queries. This idea/solution can boost the current situation of travel and tourism in our country Because it's a one platform which meets all needs of users.
